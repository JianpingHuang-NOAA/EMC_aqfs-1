C
C        The EDSS/Models-3 I/O API depends in an essential manner
C        upon the I/O API source code.  ANY CHANGES are
C        likely to result in very obscure, difficult-to-diagnose
C        bugs caused by an inconsistency between standard "libioapi.a"
C        object-libraries and whatever code is compiled with the
C        resulting modified INCLUDE-file.
C
C        By making any changes to the I/O API source code, the
C        user explicitly agrees that in the case any assistance is 
C        required of MCNC or of the I/O API author, CARLIE J. COATS, JR.
C        HE AND/OR HIS PROJECT OR CONTRACT AGREES TO REIMBURSE MCNC
C        AND/OR THE I/O API AUTHOR, CARLIE J. COATS, JR., AT A
C        RATE TRIPLE THE NORMAL CONTRACT RATE FOR THE SERVICES
C        REQUIRED.
